Data analysis and predictive modeling on marketing campaign data

## Overview

This project applies data science and analytics techniques to marketing campaign data to derive actionable insights for optimizing marketing strategies. Using Python for data analysis and machine learning, coupled with Power BI for visualization, this project demonstrates how to transform raw marketing data into strategic recommendations.


## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Data analysis, preprocessing, and modeling
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive code development

## Dataset

This project uses the [Marketing Campaign Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackdaoud/marketing-data) from Kaggle, which includes:
- Customer demographics
- Product preferences
- Campaign successes/failures
- Channel performance

## Analysis Components

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Customer demographic analysis
- Purchase behavior patterns
- Campaign performance metrics
- Correlation analysis


### 2. Feature Engineering
- Created customer value metrics
- Generated RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis
- Engineered campaign response features
- Developed channel preference indicators

### 3. Customer Segmentation
- Identified 4 distinct customer segments using K-means clustering
- Analyzed segment characteristics and behavior patterns
- Created segment profiles for targeted marketing


### 4. Predictive Modeling
- Built campaign response prediction model
- Achieved 78% accuracy in predicting customer responses
- Identified key factors influencing campaign success
- Developed probability scores for customer targeting


### 5. Marketing Recommendations
- Segment-specific campaign strategies
- Channel optimization recommendations
- High-potential customer targeting
- Implementation roadmap

## Key Findings

1. **Customer Segmentation**: Identified four distinct customer segments with unique behaviors and preferences, enabling targeted marketing strategies.

2. **Response Predictors**: Previous campaign acceptance, total spending, and web visit frequency are the strongest predictors of campaign response.

3. **Channel Effectiveness**: Web campaigns showed the highest ROI for younger segments, while catalog marketing remained effective for high-value, older customers.

4. **High-Potential Customers**: Identified 250 customers with high response probability who haven't responded to previous campaigns, representing significant revenue potential.

5. **Product Affinities**: Discovered strong correlations between wine purchases and acceptance of premium campaigns, suggesting effective cross-selling opportunities.

## Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides interactive visualizations of the analysis, including:

- Campaign performance metrics
- Customer segment profiles
- Response prediction analysis

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Power BI Desktop (for dashboard visualization)


## Future Work

- Integrate additional data sources like social media engagement
- Develop a churn prediction model
- Implement A/B testing framework for campaign optimization
- Create real-time campaign monitoring dashboard
